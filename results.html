            None of those questions you answered told me anything. I didn't even look at anything you selected, nor were there any calculations being made.

            <br><br>The quiz questions asked about your preferences and personality traits. Our society likes to categorize certain traits as masculine or feminine and shames any deviance from your assigned sex at birth. These categories, however, are completely arbitrary. There is no law of physics stating “blue is a male color” or “skirts are for girls.” In fact, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097/">more than 100 years ago</a>, pink was considered a boy color, blue was a girl color, and boys wore dresses until they were 6.

            <br><br>Traditional gender roles want to see males conforming to masculine traits while females conform to feminine ones. Of course, most of us embody a mix of feminine and masculine traits.

            <br><br>The labels attached to your personality do not determine your gender. You could tell me that you were a pink-hating car fanatic with chiseled abs, and yet I'd never be sure of your gender without you telling me. You could be a female not conforming to societal standards, a male who expresses traditional masculinity, neither because you're non-binary, or anything else. Anybody can uphold any gender norms, regardless of what they identify as. 

            <br><br>So in the end, none of these quiz questions can confidently reveal your gender identity. The only labels which determine your gender are the ones YOU give yourself. Don't let other people's categories define who you are, and remember that you are valid no matter what label you embrace.
